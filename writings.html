            <h2 class="title">What is Love</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Love. What is love? Ask people and they would give you different answers. Some would say crazy, some
                would say stupid. Some would say its non existent while the others would say indescribable. Ask the
                science people and they would give you a scientific definition which does not truly fit. Nobody knows
                the exact meaning of love. Everybody has different perceptions based on their own experiences. According
                to me, love is when you look into the eyes of that person and decide that you would do anything to let
                the twinkle in their eyes last forever. When you see a smile on their face and you are happy because you
                are the reason behind that smile. When you are ready to even lose just to see that joy of victory on
                their face. When every time your heart starts to race and your breath is caught up in your throat by the
                mere mention of their name. When your knees go weak and you get butterflies in your stomach and a warm
                fuzzy feeling as they walk towards you.
                But love can hurt. It hurts when the person who you would do anything for, is not willing to do the
                same. When they don't get the same feeling u do every time you walk towards them. When you love them
                with all your heart but they don't love you back. It pains. But we are so deeply in love with them that
                we learn to live with the pain. We embrace it. We continue to love them with all the pieces of our
                heart, shattered by the pain. We continue to lose. We continue to sacrifice. Hoping that maybe the
                person would love us back yet knowing at the back of our minds that there is not a chance. At night, we
                spend hours crying and the fuzzy feeling is replaced with an emptiness, a void feeling. Our mind & heart
                engage in countless debates. Our heart tells us to keep loving them. There still might be a chance while
                our mind says otherwise. And every night, the mind wins. But every morning when you see them smiling at
                you & walking towards you, the fuzzy feeling is back and the butterflies in your stomach return and your
                knees go weak once again. Once again, you can't help but to fall in love with them. The resolution to
                stop loving them fails epic-ally. And your heart takes control. That's love. Crazy, stupid,
                indescribable, senseless love.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Just a musing</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                “I believe that growing up is a parody. It’s a parody of our beliefs. It’s the parody of how we think,
                and it’s one of the single most cruel thing that happens to everybody, on a daily basis.” That’s what he
                thought when he was walking down the footpath.
                There was a time, when reasons held deeper meanings. When, he knew what everything meant. When he was 8,
                the thing that scared him, was the darkness. After a while, it was silence. Time has a funny way of
                making itself felt. What he feared, turned into what he hated, and then it became the familiar commuter-
                The one who annoys you so much, that you start admiring him.
                20 years later, there are things that scare him. He often pondered, what really scares him now. Was he
                really scared? Were there any reasons to be scared? Reasons, for now, have lost their meanings. Maybe,
                it’s the fact that I have nothing, that scares me. Emptiness is terrifying, because it nudges us to find
                something within. When you have no one around, you look inside to find something that would make you
                feel something. For him, that was scarier.
                Somewhere along the way, he had lost the desire to fill himself. Was it the reason why he considered
                himself sadder than the most melancholic person in the world? Talking about ways, the way back to ‘home’
                was extremely scary for him.
                With each batch of passing crowd, he felt envy engraved on him, with sharper chisels. More often than
                not, there would be this guy with a phone, to which he spoke with an eye-twinkling smile. There would be
                this woman, warning her toddler, not to stamp its feet in the puddle and then there would be the
                sharpest jab, from the couple, who held hands in the shape of a heart.
                He would re-position the the strap of his bag, hoping that it would make him comfortable. The weight of
                the work was always comforting. “At least, I have got something to when I am home”. He would avert his
                eyes, pretending to look at his shiny boots. The faces were all different, but they all reminded him of
                the same thing.
                “Sometimes, when you are doing simple things around the house, maybe you’ll think of me and smile," he
                thought. It had once inspired him, to find someone who would smile for him. He realized, not very soon,
                that thing’s tearfully difficult. It still is!!!</p>

            <p>
                Hi friends.
                This is no normal post. This post is your gateway to greater glory. I firmly believe that if you try all
                the things mentioned here you surely will grab success by the scruff of its neck.
                What success am I talking about here? You just got placed. Wao, congratulations! But did you get placed
                in an IT services MNC which has a million employees already and which hires every other engineer, which
                ever discipline they maybe from any XYZ college? If you did and if you really want to achieve something
                in life, don't want an easy, laid back life, want a bigger paycheck of course then you have to apply to
                either product based companies or companies whose name is not so well known but are doing some great
                work. Don't get me wrong here I am not undermining the work or culture at any place here. But if you
                really have the zeal for Computer Science and want to enjoy your work you have got to find a better
                workplace to start with.
                Lets get down to the options that you may have after college.
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item"><p>Higher studies.</p></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><p>Work in an IT services company, like TCS, Infosys, etc.</p></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><p>Work in a product based company or a startup.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I won't focus on the first two in this post. This post will only be about the 3rd option.
                Without wasting any further time let's look at the things you have to do :</p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item"><p>Prepare. This is the most important part. Prepare a resume and a great
                    LinkedIn profile. Make a github account, learn VCS(Google it) and start doing some projects on your
                    own or contribute to open source projects. Prepare two or three subjects. Prepare them in such a
                    manner so that you get the basics right. You are a fresher and you won't be asked very difficult or
                    deep questions. But make sure you have clear concepts of whatever you know.
                </p></li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <p>Apply. This is the second step. Once you are a little sure of yourself and feel confident, take
                        the plunge. I will list down the sites where you can apply -
                        i) Elitmus - This is good portal with lots of good opportunities but the catch here is you have
                        to first sit for a CAT style aptitude test. The questions are of CAT level more or less. Once
                        you have appeared for the test and have got a 90+℅ile in any one of the three subjects you will
                        start getting interview calls. The only con of this site is most companies require you to be
                        physically visit the interview centres which are mostly in Bengaluru/ New Delhi. So do you
                        research before deciding to travel for any companies interview call unless you are in Bengaluru.
                        ii) Amcat - This is more or less similar to Elitmus, but the test is a bit easy and it also has
                        a Technical section wherein your Domain Knowledge is tested. Cons - Average package offered is
                        lesser than Elitmus.
                        iii) Hasjob.co - This is a great site in my opinion. A lot of startups and core computer science
                        companies use it. You must have a strong resume, a good write-up some work to show on Github to
                        get interview calls here. Cons - Be careful of the jobs you apply to. If a company find you
                        unsuitable for their required profile and they feel that you have wasted their time they can ban
                        you from the site.
                        iv) Hirist.com - This is also similar to Hasjob. Cons - There is no way of knowing beforehand
                        the package the company will be offering unless explicitly mentioned in their job posting.
                        v) Coding sites - HackerEarth, HackerRank, TechGig are a few sites which can help you land a job
                        if you are good at coding.
                        vi) Other sites - Freshwersworld, Jobsire.net are a few other sites. While fresherworld is only
                        useful if you pay the initial membership fee(INR 600/yr at the time of writing) Jobspire is a
                        great site if you really want to work in an Indian Startup.</p>
                <li class="list-group-item"><p>Interviews - I won't really elaborate on this. This is all you. There is
                    already a tonne of interview preparation material online. However I would suggest a few books and
                    sites for practise. Books - Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Programming
                    Interviews Exposed. Websites - www.interviewbit.com, www.hackerearth.com/codemonk/.
